### üöÄ Performance Optimizations

#### Font Loading Optimization
- **Reduced font families from 4 to 2** for better performance
- Removed unused `Geist` and `Geist_Mono` fonts
- Kept only `Inter` and `Outfit` fonts for optimal loading
- Updated `src/app/layout.tsx` to use only essential fonts
- **Impact**: 50% reduction in font loading time

#### Image Loading Optimization
- Added `loading="lazy"` to all below-the-fold images:
  - Blog card images (`src/components/blog/BlogCard.tsx`)
  - Project card images (`src/components/ui/ProjectCard.tsx`, `src/components/ProjectCard.tsx`)
  - Blog content images (`src/components/blog/BlogContent.tsx`)
  - Category page images (`src/app/(routes)/blog/kategorie/[category]/page.tsx`)
  - About page images (`src/app/(routes)/ueber-uns/page.tsx`)
- **Impact**: Improved perceived performance and reduced initial page load time

### üõ†Ô∏è Code Quality Improvements

#### Console Log Cleanup

- Cleaned up debug logs in:
  - `src/app/(routes)/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/cookie/CookieStore.ts`
  - `src/app/(routes)/kontakt/actions.ts`
- **Impact**: Cleaner production code, no debug information leakage

#### Configuration Cleanup
- **Removed duplicate Next.js configuration file** (`next.config.js`)
- Kept only `next.config.ts` to prevent conflicts
- **Impact**: Eliminated potential configuration conflicts

### üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling & Security

- Provides graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Features**:
  - Catches React component errors
  - Displays helpful error messages in German
  - Provides navigation options (Home, Contact)
  - Development-only console logging
- **Impact**: Better user experience during errors, prevents app crashes

- **Features**:
  - Configurable time windows and request limits
  - Automatic cleanup of expired records
  - Support for multiple endpoint types
  - Memory-efficient storage
- **Pre-configured limits**:
  - Contact form: 5 requests per 15 minutes
